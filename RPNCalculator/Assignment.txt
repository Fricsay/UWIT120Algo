Create a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator using the Stack class.

our process( ) function should handle "+", "-", "*", "/", and positive/negative numbers.

When process( ) gets a number, it should push the number onto the stack.

When process( ) gets an operation, it should pop two values off the stack, perform the operation, then push the result back onto the stack. 

The result( ) function should return the last value pushed on the stack.

Hint: Your process function should explicitly handle the operations and if it's not an operation, assume it's a number and push that number on the stack.

Scenario: In RPN, "5 ENTER 4 ENTER + ENTER 3 ENTER - ENTER" yields a value of 6.
