Write the code to convert the base-62 number to base-10.

Submit your program (C#, Python, Javascript, ...) as well as the decimal number value for LpuPe81bc2w.

Hint: Use an array/string that contains all the numbers and digits: "0123456789AB...YZab...yz". 
For each letter in the base-62 number, look up the value in the string ("0123456789ABC..."). 
This gives you the base-62 value for that digit. Keep a running total and remember to keep multiplying by 62.
